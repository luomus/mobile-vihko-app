# Mobiilivihko

Mobile-Vihko is a mobile application for the Finnish government officials to map observations of e.g. animal and fungi species. Observations are marked to the map in the application. The app can be used in the terrain, so that the users can 
mark the observations which they find near their location. The app uses location data to track the path which the user has traveled. The user forms observation events in the application, which consist of the observations and the traveled path 
during this journey. Observation events are sent to [Laji.fi](https://laji.fi/) with the application.
